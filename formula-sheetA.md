SUM/DIFFERENCE & DOUBLE ANGLE FORMULAS
Sum and Difference Formulas
sin(A ± B) = sin A cos B ± cos A sin B
cos(A ± B) = cos A cos B ∓ sin A sin B
tan(A ± B) = (tan A ± tan B)/(1 ∓ tan A tan B)
Double Angle Formulas
sin(2θ) = 2sin θ cos θ
cos(2θ) = cos²θ - sin²θ = 2cos²θ - 1 = 1 - 2sin²θ
tan(2θ) = 2tan θ/(1 - tan²θ)
Half Angle (Power Reduction)
sin²θ = (1 - cos 2θ)/2
cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2
tan²θ = (1 - cos 2θ)/(1 + cos 2θ)
SOLVING TRIANGLES
Law of Sines
sin A/a = sin B/b = sin C/c
Use when you have:

AAS (two angles, one opposite side)
ASA (two angles, included side)
SSA (two sides, angle opposite one) - AMBIGUOUS CASE!
Law of Cosines
c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C
a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A
b² = a² + c² - 2ac cos B
Use when you have:

SAS (two sides, included angle)
SSS (all three sides)
Area of Triangle
Area = (1/2)ab sin C
Area = (1/2)bc sin A  
Area = (1/2)ac sin B
Triangle Strategy: Draw diagram → Identify given type → Choose appropriate law → Solve step by step → Check: A + B + C = 180°

TRIG GRAPHS & TRANSFORMATIONS

y = A sin(Bx + C) + D    or    y = A cos(Bx + C) + D
Amplitude: |A|
Period: 2π/|B|
Phase Shift: -C/B (left if +, right if -)
Vertical Shift: D (up if +, down if -)
Secant & Cosecant
y = A sec(Bx + C) + D
y = A csc(Bx + C) + D
Vertical Asymptotes:

sec: where cos = 0
csc: where sin = 0
Period: 2π/|B| (same as sin/cos)

INVERSE TRIG FUNCTIONS
Domains & Ranges
sin⁻¹x: Domain [-1,1], Range [-π/2, π/2]
cos⁻¹x: Domain [-1,1], Range [0, π]
tan⁻¹x: Domain (-∞,∞), Range (-π/2, π/2)
Compositions with Inverse Trig
For expressions like cos(tan⁻¹(x)):

Let θ = tan⁻¹(x), so tan θ = x
Draw right triangle with opposite = x, adjacent = 1
Find hypotenuse: √(x² + 1)
cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse = 1/√(x² + 1)
SOLVING TRIG EQUATIONS
Basic Strategy
Isolate the trig function
Find reference angle
Identify all angles in given interval
Check quadrants for sign
Add period multiples if needed
Common Solution Patterns
sin θ = k: θ = arcsin(k) + 2πn  or  θ = π - arcsin(k) + 2πn
cos θ = k: θ = ±arccos(k) + 2πn
tan θ = k: θ = arctan(k) + πn
Example: 2sin²x - 11cos x - 7 = 0 → Use sin²x = 1 - cos²x → Solve quadratic in cos x

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS
End Behavior (Leading Coefficient Test)
Even degree + positive leading coeff: both ends up ↗↗
Even degree + negative leading coeff: both ends down ↘↘
Odd degree + positive leading coeff: left down, right up ↘↗
Odd degree + negative leading coeff: left up, right down ↗↘
Finding Zeros
Rational Root Theorem:

Possible rational zeros = ±(factors of constant)/(factors of leading coeff)
Synthetic Division: Test each possible root. If remainder = 0, then it's a zero.

Multiplicity:

Odd multiplicity: graph crosses x-axis
Even multiplicity: graph touches x-axis (turning point)
Important: For polynomials with real coefficients, complex zeros come in conjugate pairs. If a + bi is a zero, then a - bi is also a zero.

RATIONAL FUNCTIONS
Asymptotes
Vertical Asymptotes: Set denominator = 0, solve for x (only if numerator ≠ 0 at same x-value)

Horizontal Asymptotes:

deg(numerator) < deg(denominator): y = 0
deg(numerator) = deg(denominator): y = ratio of leading coeffs
deg(numerator) > deg(denominator): no horizontal asymptote
Slant (Oblique) Asymptotes: deg(numerator) = deg(denominator) + 1. Use polynomial long division.

Holes vs Asymptotes
Factor numerator and denominator completely
Cancel common factors → creates holes
Remaining denominator factors → vertical asymptotes
For hole at x = a: find y by substituting into simplified function
Solving Rational Inequalities
Move everything to one side
Factor numerator and denominator
Find zeros (numerator = 0) and vertical asymptotes (denom = 0)
Create sign chart with critical points
Test each interval
Include zeros for ≤ or ≥, exclude asymptotes
EXPONENTIAL & LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
Exponential Functions
General Form: f(x) = ab^x + k
Natural Form: f(x) = ae^x + k
Growth/Decay:

b > 1: exponential growth
0 < b < 1: exponential decay
Compound Interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)    (n times per year)
A = Pe^(rt)            (continuous compounding)
Logarithmic Functions
Definition: y = log_b(x) ⟺ b^y = x

Properties:

log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)
log_b(x/y) = log_b(x) - log_b(y)
log_b(x^n) = n·log_b(x)
log_b(b^x) = x,  b^(log_b(x)) = x
log_b(1) = 0,  log_b(b) = 1
Change of Base: log_b(x) = log_c(x)/log_c(b)

Solving Exponential/Log Equations
Exponential Equations:

Isolate exponential expression
Take log of both sides
Use properties to solve for variable
Logarithmic Equations:

Combine logs using properties
Convert to exponential form
Solve algebraically
Check domain restrictions!
Important: log_b(x) requires x > 0. Always check final answers in original equation.

FUNCTION OPERATIONS & INVERSES
Function Composition
(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES
By Topic
Triangles: Identify given info (AAS, SAS, etc.) → choose appropriate law
Trig Equations: Use identities to simplify, find reference angles
